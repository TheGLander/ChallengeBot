# Description
You know how sometimes while chatting you wish to have a little fun?
Well, Challenge bot solves that! It creates random challenges to keep you on your toes!

In each challenge, the Bot picks a random letter (English) and your goal is to say as many words as you can that starts with that letter.

Each challenge has restricted time.

When you say a valid word(That starts with the letter, Is a real word, and not re-used) the bot will give you a coin!


When the time limit comes You'll need to wait a bit for a new challenge, you know, to cool things down.
